# Tour-planner
## UX
Home Screen:


The main area displays a list of created tours. Each tour entry has options to modify or delete.
An "Add" button is prominently placed, possibly in the top right corner or as a floating action button at the bottom.
If no tours are present, this area displays a message indicating the list is empty, with a prompt or the "Add" button to create a new tour.
Tour Creation/Edit Screen:

When the "Add" button is pressed or a tour is chosen to be modified, the user is taken to a form screen.
This screen includes fields for tour details. The exact fields depend on the information required (e.g., name, date, description).
Feedback mechanisms for wrong inputs include inline validation messages under the relevant fields.
A "Save" button to create or update the tour.
Tour Logs Screen:

Accessible by clicking on a specific tour from the home screen.
Displays detailed logs of the selected tour.
Each log entry has options to modify, delete, or add a new one.
An "Add New Log" button is also present to create new log entries directly.
Feedback and Error Handling:

Error messages or feedback on wrong inputs are displayed near the action button or field, with clear instructions on how to correct it.
User Experience (UX) Description
Ease of Navigation:

The user journey from viewing tours to modifying or adding new ones is streamlined, with minimal steps and clear navigation cues.
Actions like adding, editing, and deleting are easily accessible, enhancing the user's ability to manage tours efficiently.
Feedback and Validation:

Immediate feedback on actions, especially for form validations, helps users correct errors without frustration. For example, if a user enters an incorrect date format, a message appears explaining the expected format.
Consistency and Clarity:

The UI maintains consistency in design elements, such as buttons and form fields, ensuring users quickly learn the interface's logic.
Clear, concise text labels and instructions guide the user, reducing confusion and the likelihood of errors.
Empty States and Onboarding:

For new users or when no tours are available, the application provides guidance on getting started, making the app feel welcoming and easy to use from the start.
The empty state for the tours list not only informs users that there are no tours but also encourages them to create one, making the app's functionality immediately apparent.
Visual Hierarchy and Focus:

The design uses size, color, and placement to create a visual hierarchy that guides the user's attention to important elements, such as the "Add" buttons and feedback message
